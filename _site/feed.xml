If so, how do attackers exploit it and how do application developers defend against such attacks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I delivered a talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke7ZYxvqLGE&quot;&gt;Steelcon 2018&lt;/a&gt; which explores the functionality exposed by the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) framework that could be exploited to achieve screen recording or automated input on a stock, non-rooted android device. The talk also discusses the defences placed by AOSP developers to prevent the abuse of this functionality. Finally a couple of vulnerabilities I’ve identified in the AOSP framework are discussed and demonstrated that circumvent these defences and allow an android application to record the user’s screen and/or automated input.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Is it possible for an android application to surreptitiously record a user’s screen and/or automate user input?
