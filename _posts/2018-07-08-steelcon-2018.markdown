Is it possible for an android application to surreptitiously record a user’s screen and/or automate user input? If so, how do attackers exploit it and how do application developers defend against such attacks?

I delivered a talk at [Steelcon 2018][youtube] which explores the functionality exposed by the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) framework that could be exploited to achieve screen recording or automated input on a stock, non-rooted android device. The talk also discusses the defences placed by AOSP developers to prevent the abuse of this functionality. Finally a couple of vulnerabilities I’ve identified in the AOSP framework are discussed and demonstrated that circumvent these defences and allow an android application to record the user’s screen and/or automated input.
